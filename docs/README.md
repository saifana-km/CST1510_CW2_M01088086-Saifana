# Week 7: Secure Authentication System
Student Name: [Saifana Kuradiela Maryam] 
Student ID: [M01088086]
Course: CST1510 -CW2 - Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform
## Project Description
A command-line authentication system implementing secure password hashing
This system allows users to register accounts and log in with proper passwords and usernames
## Features
